<h1>Coloring in Enshrouded</h1>
<h2>The Coloring Station</h2>
<p>The coloring station in Enshrouded gives players lots of options when customizing your character's look. This applies to most armors and all of the cosmetic items, and I thought it would be cool to have a site where players can mess with both palettes and dyeable armors.<br>
The following images show the variety of what the player can find in-game. Though all have an attached quest, they can still be found in certain areas of the open world.</p>
<h3>Example Palettes</h3>
<p>Each palette is made up of three colors, one making up around 70%, one making up around 20%, and the last only taking up around 10% of a full dyed set of equipment. Following are the links to the dyes themselves, as well as their appearance in-game.</p>
